# warriorhamster - Bringing TaskWarrior and Project Hamster together

Depends on [Project Hamster](https://github.com/projecthamster/hamster), [TaskWarrior](https://github.com/taskwarrior/task), and [python-taskw](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/taskw).

This script aims to allow you to "start" TaskWarrior tasks and simultaneously have a corresponding activity start in Project Hamster. You can also use it to "stop" a Project Hamster activity and simultaneously mark the corresponding TaskWarrior task as being 'done'. It is a CLI-only tool as of now.
